\ SMW-style level data building lexicon

\ - levels stored as human-readable source
\ - map data uses memory efficiently
\ - independent of game-specific subsystems and other modules (so it requires some glue)

\ these are data structures involved:
\  map header
\    layer table
\    layer header
\      map object

\  map table
\  bg object table
\  actor object table

\ Features of this component:
\  - Semantics for declaring and reading back map objects (shared by BG and Actors.)
\  - High level directory semantics (maps, layers, pointers, tables)
\  - Semantics for defining BG and Actor object types

\ NTS: this is an opportunity to save memory if ever needed.  i've already
\  created generic rect words.  we could redefine the internal representation
\  of map objects to take up just a few bytes instead of 24.  (useful for an
\  8-bit conversion.)
\  For now, I'm just trying to save effort so I've used the standard /rect struct.
