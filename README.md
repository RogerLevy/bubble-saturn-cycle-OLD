# Saturn Cycle
Interim example game for pluralistic game dev framework Bubble Framework / Saturn Engine for Forth.

More of a feature demo than a game, it's just a test level from a game that may or may not be made, starring a little earwig.

## Requirements

* SwiftForth 3.5.3 and up
* Windows 7 and up
* OpenGL 2.0 capable video driver  

## Directions

1. Clone
2. Clone the [engine repo](https://github.com/rogerlevy/bubble-engine-subrepo) into engine\ 
3. In SwiftForth, navigate to the project folder and `include dev`, or, open the komodoproject and press F5.

## What's Next

I'm just trying to stage things to work on more seriously later.  

Eventually, several examples will be in subfolders of a main framework repo which will reference the engine repo as a subtree, once I figure out how to do it.

Some essential things are still being figuerd out, but the Core is pretty much complete.  

Saturn Engine is too complex for a beginner and doesn't really show off the full potential of the framework & dev environment yet.

GForth and VFX ports?
