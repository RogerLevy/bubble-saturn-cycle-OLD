\ object scripting testing aid

\  redefines several words to modify already-defined node class info in-place.
\  restarts all active actors with the class specified by `START:`
\  
\  the point of this feature is to allow us total freedom in choosing
\  simple word names so that each class's script can be properly factored,
\  but still regain access to any buried aforementioned words just by
\  reloading the script. use UPDATE <classname>
