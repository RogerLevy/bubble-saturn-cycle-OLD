\ MINI STRING-BUILDING TUTORIAL
\ If you want to build the string " This is a test" from the four words
\ You can use the following example code
\ : mini-string-building-tutorial  ( - )  \ example code for string building
\   " This" s[  \ start builder-string
\   "  is" +s   \ append to builder-string
\   "  a" +s    \ append to builder-string
\   "  test" +s \ append to builder-string
\   ]s          \ finish building the string and fetch the finished counted string
